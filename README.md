Payant Android can be used to access features on your [Payant](https://payant.ng/) account dashboard. 

It is assumed that this library wouldn't be used on a client facing App but rather for secure and private use. This is because it uses your account private key for initilization. 

For better understanding read the [Payant API documentation](https://developers.payant.ng/overview) before using this library.
