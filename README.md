Payant Android can be used to access features on your Payant account dashboard. 

It is not meant to be used in public apps that are handled by clients, rather it's to be used to personally access invoicing features on your personal Payant account. This library can be used to make a custom personal app that does just that. 

I strongly advise that you read the Payant API documentation before using this library, that would make the whole process of understanding the library a lot faster and easier.
